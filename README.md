# Teambuilder Discord Bot for Coromon!
A Discord bot with team-building functionality for the popular RPG game Coromon. You can pretty much download the entire repo and just insert your bot `TOKEN`. Any issues will most likely be package dependencies and version. The game is currently in its demo phase so the bot will have to be updated once there is a full release.

### Adaption 
If you are looking to make a teambuilder for an RPG game, this repo can be pretty good base. The main things to change would be areas that have `SelectMenu`s and `Button` as these were customed made to fit a certain amount of values. A few tweaks to the `Mon` class structure would also be needed, and after that it would just be reformatting the `Embeds` to your liking.
